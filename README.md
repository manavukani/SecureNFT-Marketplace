## Inspiration

The inspiration behind SecureNFT Marketplace stemmed from the growing demand for a secure and transparent platform in the NFT space. As NFTs gained popularity, so did concerns about security and trustworthiness. We wanted to address these concerns by creating a marketplace that prioritizes the security and integrity of NFT transactions while offering a user-friendly experience.

## What's Next for SecureNFT Marketplace

- Add approval for NFTs once uploaded to appear on marketplace (update smart contract)
- Integrate APIs to get NFTs from different marketplaces, like Alchemy API
- Add cross comptability, if my wallet has NFT on say, OpenSea marketplace, it appears here as well
